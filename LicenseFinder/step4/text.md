# Step 4: Run LicenseFinder (and Install the Needed Package Manager)

Letâ€™s try running LicenseFinder right away in our sample project directory:

## Pull dependencies

We first have to build our project, in this example we just need to pull dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```{{exec}}

## Run Licensefinder

Run LicenseFinder:

```bash
license_finder
```{{exec}}

(This can take a couple of seconds ~10-30).





## Leaving this in so I dont forget about the outline

Please set it up so that about two errors appear here, paste the actual software license URL, and let us fix it to ensure it's okay.

So, create a script that allows you to proceed to the next step if the answer is correct.
