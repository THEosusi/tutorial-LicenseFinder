# Step 5: Run LicenseFinder (and Install the Needed Package Manager)

Letâ€™s try running LicenseFinder right away in our sample project directory:

## Pull dependencies

We first have to build our project, in this example we just need to pull dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```{{exec}}

## Run Licensefinder

```bash
license_finder
```{{exec}}

(This can take a couple of seconds ~10-30).
