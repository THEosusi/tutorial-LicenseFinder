## Appendix: Other Dependency License Management Tools

In this tutorial, we introduced LicenseFinder, focusing on its lightweight nature and ease of integration into CI/CD pipelines. We will briefly introduce several other recommended tools for dependency license management.


[ScanCode Toolkit](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit)

ScanCode Toolkit is an open-source tool for scanning licenses, packages, and dependencies. It detects dependencies throughout the entire codebase, including binary files, so while detection accuracy is good, it can take a long time to complete scans. Several companies have adopted it, making it worth considering for your projects.

[FOSSA](https://fossa.com/)

FOSSA is a paid, cloud-based tool that offers more than license checks. It also handles dependency updates and can perform security scans on libraries based on dependency information. It is particularly useful if you prefer not to integrate extensive code into your CI pipelines.

[FOSSology](https://github.com/fossology/fossology) and [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) are also available.

By exploring LicenseFinder and these additional tools, you can ensure that your projects remain compliant with open-source licenses. Integrating license management into your CI/CD pipeline helps prevent legal and compliance issues before they arise.
