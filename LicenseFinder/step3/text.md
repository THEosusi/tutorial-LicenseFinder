# Step 3: Clone a Sample Project

To use LicenseFinder, we need an actual project with dependencies to scan.  
In a real scenario, this would be **your own project**.

## PLACCEHOLDER REPLACE WITH OUR OWN PROJECT

For this tutorial, weâ€™ll use a public example project:

- **Repo:** [simple-java-maven-app](https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app)

This project is a small Java + Maven app with dependencies we can test LicenseFinder on.

## PLACCEHOLDER REPLACE WITH OUR OWN PROJECT

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app
```{{exec}}

Then change into the project directory:

```bash
cd simple-java-maven-app
```{{exec}}

You are now almost able to run licensefinder.
