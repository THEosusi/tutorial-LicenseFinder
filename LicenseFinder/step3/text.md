# Step 3: Clone a Sample Project

To use LicenseFinder, we need an actual project with dependencies to scan.  
In a real scenario, this would be **your own project**.


For this tutorial, weâ€™ll use a public example project:

- **Repo:** [DD2443-Executable-Tutorial-Dependency-Example](https://github.com/rifat4/DD2443-Executable-Tutorial-Dependency-Example)

This project is a small Java + Maven app with dependencies we can test LicenseFinder on.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rifat4/DD2482-Executable-Tutorial-Python-Example.git
```{{exec}}

Then change into the project directory:

```bash
cd DD2482-Executable-Tutorial-Python-Example
```{{exec}}

You are now almost able to run licensefinder.
