## Step 1: Install Ruby

LicenseFinder does not ship as a standalone executable. It is distributed as a Ruby gem, which means we need to have Ruby installed first before we can install and run LicenseFinder.

### Install Ruby

Run the following command to install Ruby (the full package) on your system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ruby-full
```{{exec}}

This can take 10-30 seconds.
