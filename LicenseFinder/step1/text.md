# Step 1: Install Ruby

LicenseFinder does not ship as a standalone executable.  
It is distributed as a Ruby gem, which means we need to have Ruby installed first before we can install and run LicenseFinder.

## Install Ruby

Run the following command to install Ruby (the full package) on your system:

<pre>
<code class="language-bash" data-kc-click="true">
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ruby-full
</code>
</pre>
